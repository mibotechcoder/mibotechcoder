## 👋 Hi, I'm Michael (aka mibotechcoder) ##

🚀 AI Developer | Mechatronics Engineer | ML Enthusiast | Python Learner

🎯 Building modular AI agents that bring automation, context, and intelligence to any domain

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a tech-savvy, solution-driven mechatronics engineer and AI innovator with 30+ years of coding experience.  
My passion lies in developing Model Context Protocols (MCPs) and modular Language Model Modules (LMMs), smart agents that can interface with applications, data, and humans via natural language.

I specialize in building bridges between traditional control logic and modern AI models. Whether it's optimizing heat pump behavior, parsing vCards into Power Apps, or simulating EV charging times, I enjoy solving complex problems with elegant, modular design.

My goal is to enable AI to act meaningfully in any domain where digital logic and automation can improve decision-making, comfort, or sustainability.

I'm also currently prototyping assistant agents that learn from context, adapt to changing inputs, and provide transparent support across industries, from smart buildings and energy to transportation and knowledge work.
